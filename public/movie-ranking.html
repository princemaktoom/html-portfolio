<h1>The Best Movies According to Prince</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>‘3 Idiots’ charts the japes and scrapes of three students at India’s top engineering university. Along the way, this coming-of-age comedy addresses ‘ragging’ (initiation rituals), the intense pressure to excel in education, student suicide and the tension between the ambitions of students and their parents. ‘3 Idiots’ was a huge hit and confirmed Aamir Khan as the master of balancing good old-fashioned family entertainment with meaningful messages.</p>
<h3>Sholay</h3>
<p>The biggest hit of Bollywood and a cult classic.Sholay is a story about 2 thieves who are recruited by an ex cop to fight against the bandit 'Gabbar'(one of the most iconic villan in Indian cinema).The dialouges, bromance, entertainment everything is top notch in this one.</p>
<h3>Om Shanti Om</h3>
<p>A runaway hit on release, ‘Om Shanti Om’ achieved what other similar films before it had tried and largely failed to do – to satirise the idiosyncrasies of the Hindi film industry. ‘Om Shanti Om’ manages this while wearing the garb of a clichéd reincarnation story. Om (Khan) is a junior artist in love with superstar Shanti (Padukone) in the 1970s. Shanti, though, is in love with a wily producer, Mukesh Mehra (Rampal), who has her killed. In the present day, Om is now a superstar out to exact revenge on Mehra, now settled in Hollywood.</p>
